This package provides a simulation and reconstruction framework for fMRI data. It is designed to be used for benchmarking and testing of fMRI reconstruction methods.


## Installation
### Requirements 
- A working Python 3.10 environment  or higher 
- Optional: a working CUDA environment for NUFFT accelerations. See [mri-nufft](https://github.com/mind-inria/mri-nufft) for details. SNAKE works best with a fast GPU NUFFT Backend such as [cufinufft](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft) or [gpuNUFFT](https://github.com/chaithyagr/gpuNUFFT)


### from PyPA (soon)

It is recommended to install the SNAKE toolkit on top of the core runtime (the toolkit contains reconstructors, statistical analysis tool and the CLI to run experiments).

``` sh
pip install snake-fmri[toolkit]
```

Some Reconstructors requires extra dependencies such as [pysap-fmri](https://github.com/paquiteau/pysap-fmri) or [patch-denoising](https://github.com/paquiteau/patch-denoising)


### Development version 

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:paquiteau/snake-fmri 
cd snake-fmri 
pip install -e .[test,dev,doc,toolkit]
```
