Single anatomical EPI with SNAKE-fMRI
=====================================

This examples walks through the elementary components of SNAKE.

Here we proceed step by step and use the Python interface. A more integrated
alternative is to use the CLI ``snake-main``

# Creating the base Phantom
# -------------------------
#
# The simulation acquires
# the data describe in a phantom. A phantom consists of fuzzy segmentation of
# head tissue, and their MR intrinsic parameters
# (density, T1, T2, T2*,  magnetic susceptibilities)
#
# Here we use Brainweb reference mask and values for convenience.

# Setting up Acquisition Pattern and Initializing Result file.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# The next piece of simulation is the acquisition trajectory.
# Here nothing fancy, we are using a EPI (fully sampled), that samples a 3D
# k-space (this akin to the 3D EPI sequence of XXXX)

sampler = EPI3dAcquisitionSampler(accelz=1, acsz=0.1, orderz="top-down")

# %%
# Acquisition with Cartesian Engine
# ---------------------------------
#
# The generated file ``example_EPI.mrd`` does not contains any k-space data for
# now, only the sampling trajectory. let's put some in. In order to do so, we
# need to setup the **acquisition engine** that models the MR physics, and get
# sampled at the specified k-space trajectory.
#
# SNAKE comes with two models for the MR Physics:
#
# - model="simple" :: Each k-space shot acquires a constant signal, which is the
#   image contrast at TE.
# - model="T2s" :: Each k-space shot is degraded by the T2* decay induced by
#   each tissue.

# Here we will use the "simple" model, which is faster.
#
# SNAKE's Engine are capable of simulating the data in parallel, by distributing
# the shots to be acquired to a set of processes. To do so , we need to specify
# the number of jobs that will run in parallel, as well as the size of a job.
# Setting the job size and the number of jobs can have a great impact on total
# runtime and memory consumption.
#
# Here, we have a single frame to acquire with 60 frames (one EPI per slice), so
# a single worker will do.

# Simple reconstruction
# ---------------------
#
# Getting k-space data is nice, but
# SNAKE also provides rudimentary reconstruction tools to get images (and check
# that we didn't mess up the acquisition process).
# This is available in the companion package ``snake.toolkit``.
#
# Loading the ``.mrd`` file to retrieve all information can be done using the
# ``ismrmd`` python package, but SNAKE provides convenient dataloaders, which are
# more efficient, and take cares of managing underlying files access. As we are
# showcasing the API, we will do things manually here, and use only core SNAKE.
